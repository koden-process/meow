## Try It

Do you not have a server? - [Try this ](https://hello.sales-funnel.app/).

## How to Install

This project is written in Typescript and split into two parts, the frontend written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the backend based on [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/). You find the React UI sources in `/frontend`, the server in `/backend`.

### Your own Server - Backend

In order to build the project make sure that you have Node.js v16+ and higher and Git installed.

Clone a copy into your local project directory.

`git clone https://github.com/nash-md/meow.git`

Change the directory to `/backend` and install the dependencies.

`npm install`

Build the project using

`npm run build`

Before you run the build, youâ€™ll need to define the following variables for later use.

- `MONGODB_URI` - pointing to your MongoDB instance.
- `SESSION_SECRET` - a string used to hash the JWT sessons
- `PORT` - server port, if not set the server will use port `9000`
- `LOG_LEVEL` - self-explanatory

Run the project with

`node build/worker.js`

If you want to load environment variables from a file, install dotenv package to handle local environment variables.

`npm install dotenv`

In the root directory create a file called `.env`, then add the following to top of worker.ts

```
import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();
```

After the build, you will find the UI in the `/build` directory.

### Frontend

Change the directory to `/frontend` and install the dependencies.

`npm install`

Before building the React frontend, you'll need to set the following variables.

- `REACT_APP_URL` this is the url the frontend will try to connect to, if not set it will try to connect to the backend on the same server on `/public` and `/api`.

This project was built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) without any build modification. You can build it by executing

`npm run build`

You will find the build artifacts in the `build` directory. Host the static files it on the server of your choice.
